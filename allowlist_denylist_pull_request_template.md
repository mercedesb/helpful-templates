## Background
* For a long time blacklist/whitelist has been the default terminology in technology to refer to entities that are refused/provided a particular privilege, service, mobility, access or recognition. 
rejection.
* This language is offensive at worst and inaccurate at best.
* This project uses this language ... _describe how this language is used in the project_

## Motivation
Language is powerful and shapes our reality. It is also constantly evolving. The concept of black as bad and white as good has roots in racist ideology and should no longer be used.

We have more accurate words to describe the function of refusing or providing privileges to applications. Denylist and Allowlist clearly describe the desired functionality and reduce cognitive load in understanding the inherent metaphor in blacklist/whitelist.
